//! cargo-xtask is a pattern which provides a platform-independent way to run build scripts by writing them in Rust.
//! While many of the build scripts are to some degree platform-specific, there's a lot of shared logic that is nice
//! to be able to reuse between platforms.
//! See https://github.com/matklad/cargo-xtask for more information.
