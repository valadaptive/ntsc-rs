Wait! Before requesting a feature:

- Check the FAQ: https://ntsc.rs/docs/faq/

- Search the Issues section to see if this feature has already been requested,
  and if it has, leave a comment on that issue instead:

Keep in mind, ntsc-rs is not a replacement for video editing software. If you
need to do things like crop, speed up, slow down, or color-correct videos, you
should use real video editing software. Much of it supports using ntsc-rs as a
plugin. DaVinci Resolve is a good video editor that is available for free and
supports the ntsc-rs OpenFX plugin.
