- Resolve seems to load my unsigned OFX plugin fine, but the Mac App Store version notes it may not support all third-party OFX plugins. Is code signing required for that?
- Need to upgrade to the latest version of the AE SDK; hopefully it's backwards compatible with older AEs

- OFX plugin (done?)
  - OFX says Info.plist is necessary on macOS and "needs to be filled in appropriately" (???)
    - seems to work fine though
- Build universal binary for OFX plugin (done)
  - `cargo xtask build-plugin --macos-universal --release`
- Auto code signing and notarization for everything
- Standalone application
  - `PKG_CONFIG_ALLOW_CROSS=1 cargo build --target=[...]` seems to work fine when cross compiling w/ gstreamer
  - App bundle for standalone application
  - Probably signing also :(
- Build AE plugin
  - Get rez working to generate .rsrc from PiPL (done)
  - Cargo xtask to build x86 and ARM versions of AE plugin, combine, bundle, and sign
  - AE plugins are actually bundles
  - Needs code signing to run AFAIK
- Do it on CI
